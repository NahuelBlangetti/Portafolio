                     ðŸ’» Hi, I'm a Full Stack developer with skills in Python, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, NodeJS and with frameworks like Angular, Laravel, React and Express.
                     <br />
                        My coding journey began in college, where I dabbled in the world of programming while doing a 2-year term in Systems Engineering. That's when Python first caught my attention. From there, I went the DIY route, delving into docs, forums, YouTube rabbit holes, 
                        and  Udemy courses. This is how I got acquainted with web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and many other frameworks.
                     <br />
                     ðŸ”¸My goal is to continue growing both in work experience and in knowledge of new technologies.
                     <br />
                     ðŸ”¹I highlight my taste for programming since it helps me overcome obstacles, challenges, learn about new technologies and train myself day by day.
                  </p>
